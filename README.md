*RightAway features a web app focused on bridging the gap between doctors and their patients by offering a seamless way for doctors to manage relevant patient data and expose their availability for each working day. Doctors expose their available hours to enable the patients(with verified user account), that are assigned to that doctor, to choose an appointment from available slots(exposed by the doctor) and schedule it. Doctors and patients have different user interfaces. When loged in a patient can see list of appointment slots then he selects the desired time slot an is offered to fill out the form in which he describes his condition and answers few questions of interest. Patient then submits the form which is then revised by the doctor. The doctor gives a time estimate for the appointment and updates available timeslots. Patient then recieves verification of the appointment and is free from the well-known waitingroom drama. More features pending.*
